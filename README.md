## Features

Users can **add pre-defined green cubes** on any detected planes, or **restart** the experience to clear all existing cubes.

The cubes support **translation**, **rotation** and **scaling** operations so that users can transform them in the AR environment easily. Cubes can be **removed** by tapping twice as well.

The bottom "P" button is a shutter button which users can tap to **take a picture** with the cubes instantly and save it to the device's photo album.
